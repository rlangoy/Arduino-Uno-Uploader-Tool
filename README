DESCRIPTION:
    Arduino Uno Uloader Tool is a easy to use windows tool for uploading .hex file to 
    an Arduino Uno Board (http://arduino.cc/en/Main/ArduinoBoardUno)        

SITE: 
    http://rlangoy.github.com/Arduino-Uno-Uploader-Tool/

FEATURES:

    Easy to use gui.

    Automaticaly detects and select if a new USB/Serial port is connected to the PC.

    Allsettings is restored when the program is restarted.

    More functions is coming for displaying RS232 data from the Arduino board.

SYNOPSIS:

    When the program starts it creates a configuration file (config.ini) and the file
    is updated width changes when the program exites
         
     Example content of a config.ini file:
       [Config]
       comPort=COM35
       fileName=C:\work\test.hex
       arduinoUnoParamsVer5=-F -v -pm328p -c arduino -b 115200
       bUseUsbNotifycations=True

       When the user pushed the upload button avrdude is started width the folowing parameters:
           -F -v -pm328p -c arduino -b 115200 -P\\.\COM35 -D -Uflash:w:"c:\work\test.hex":i

       The config.ini file could be modifyed so that the program could be used to program other Arduino boards


      config.ini parameters:
          
	[Config]  comPort              - serial port that is used to program the Arduino borad
	[Config]  fileName             - the name and location of the intel .hex file to upload 
	[Config]  arduinoUnoParamsVer5 - additional params used by avrdude to program the Arduino borad
	[Config]  bUseUsbNotifycations - Detect / not detect if a new USB to RS232 device was insertet to the system
				         (a Arduino Board)
